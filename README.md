## About
An upcoming arthropod identification service made for a school project. The service will be a PC- and mobile-access website that sources information from a database to help clients more easily identify an arthropod they find based on its appearance, behaviors, and sounds <i>and</i> gives them an option to publicly upload video/audio of an arthropod to permit an AI to try to identify it for the client.
