Go on, check out the [new site](https://inspect.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page) hosted on Miraheze *and* the [old site](https://ins-p-ect.weebly.com) hosted on Weebly.

## About
An upcoming arthropod identification service made for a school project. The service will be a PC- and mobile-access website that sources information from a database to help clients more easily identify an arthropod they find based on its appearance, behaviors, and known taxonomy to try to identify it for the client. There's no guarantee the algorithm is accurate, but it should work *in theory*.
### Built with
* **Python** (3.9.0 to 3.11.0) (+**Pandas**)
* **JavaScript** (+**[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**) (+**[D3.js](https://d3js.org)**)
* **[MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)** (1.36 to 1.42) (+**DynamicPageList3**)
* **PHP7** (Miraheze only)
* **Less** (Weebly only)
* **CSS3** (both sites)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* **SQL** (for the preparation of files uploaded to the website; the sites themselves is *not* dependent upon the SQL database)
* **Less** Enabling (to prevent Weebly front-end breakage)
* **[Wikitext, a MediaWiki-specific Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext)** (Miraheze only)

### Installation
This product should not be installed unless someone wishes to improve the programming stored within this repository; in that case, see the ***Contributing*** section. Instead, go to ***website URL*** and the site should be available. For more information about usage, the section below may be beneficial to read.
## Usage
Use however you'd like.

If forked, make sure to fix `.gitignore` to your liking because I made sure I could see all JS warnings while suppressing all warnings from PyCharm. If you're fine with these settings, though, leave that file alone.

## Acknowledgements
The following people were very, very helpful with my project:
 - Dr. Bixler: thank you so much for being there for us capstone students as you assisted us in managing our rates of progress, helped us with general questions, and provided us the motivation to keep working through the most difficult parts of our projects.
 - Mr. Gery: thank you for going out of your way with helping us install environments and softwares for our school devices. Without you, we wouldn't have been able to make as much progress...if any at all.
