## Premise
An upcoming arthropod identification service made for a school project. The service will be a PC- and mobile-access website that sources information from a database to help clients more easily identify an arthropod they find based on its appearance, behaviors, and sounds <i>and</i> gives them an option to publicly upload video/audio of an arthropod to permit an AI to try to identify it for the client.
## Programming and Database Management Languages
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;**Python 3.11.0** and/or **R (version not decided)** for AI development<br>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;**SQL (version not decided)** for the storage of user profile information and AI training data (*maybe*)<br>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;**JavaScript (version not decided)** for some interaction between front-end and back-end features
## Markup Languages
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;**HTML** for the low-storage version of the website<br>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;**CSS** for the default website
## Specs and Frameworks
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;The developer is currently clueless on this front, but the website should not take more than 500MB to load<br>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;The great amount of training data may need AWS to back it up, but the developer is not sure if this is necessary yet<br>
&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;The host domain has not been decided yet because most of the ones known to the developer are not free or helpful
