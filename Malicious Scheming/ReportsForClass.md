# Reports for Class
This is a directory of external links my proposal, reports, report scripts, poster, and cumulative project journal for the class to view. 
All the pages directed from the links should be universally public, but if their content has been privated and you would like to have access to them, please contact ericakeklak@gmail.com. Please do not ask for access to any of the documents listed in `Self-Scheduling`, though, because that was intended only for me.
